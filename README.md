# Library Management using Linked List in C++

This C++ program implements a simple library management system using linked lists. There are two main classes: Book, representing books available in the library, and Student, representing students who have issued books. The LibrarySystem class manages operations such as issuing and returning books, displaying student details , displaying available books and maintaining the book list.

When the program starts, a set of default books are initialized along with their number of copies . Students can issue available books by providing their name and email, and the system decrements the number of copies of book from the library list and stores it in the student list. When a book is returned, it is removed from the student list and increments the number of copies of book in the library list

The system provides a menu-driven interface that repeatedly allows the user to issue, return, or view student details , view available books until they choose to exit.
