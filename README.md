# Library Management using Linked List in C++

This C++ program implements a simple library management system using linked lists. There are two main classes: Book, representing books available in the library, and Student, representing students who have issued books. The LibrarySystem class manages operations such as issuing and returning books, displaying student details, and maintaining the book list.

When the program starts, a set of default books are initialized. Students can issue available books by providing their name and email, and the system removes the book from the library list and stores it in the student list. When a book is returned, it is removed from the student list and added back to the library.

The system provides a menu-driven interface that repeatedly allows the user to issue, return, or view student details until they choose to exit.
